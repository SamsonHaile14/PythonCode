This repository contains the source code to a tetris variation game called Gravris.

Gravris contains elements of the original tetris with a few twists. Blocks can fall towards any wall, allowing lines to be cleared vertically and horizontally along each wall. In multiplayer modes, competing players can strategically place blocks to interfere with other players.
